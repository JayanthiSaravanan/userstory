Adding a Course:

Upon accessing the course management section, I should see an option/button to "Add Course".
Clicking on the "Add Course" button should reveal a form with fields to input course details such as course name, course code/ID, instructor name, and schedule (if applicable).
The form should also include validation to ensure required fields are filled out.
Input Validation:

The system should validate the input data to ensure correctness and consistency (e.g., proper formatting of course code, valid instructor name).
Informative error messages should be displayed if any validation fails, guiding the user on how to correct the input.
Saving Course Information:

After entering the course details and submitting the form, the system should save the course information associated with the user's profile.
A confirmation message should be displayed upon successful addition of the course, indicating that the operation was completed successfully.
Viewing Added Courses:

Users should be able to view the list of courses they have added to their profile.
The list should display relevant information for each course (e.g., course name, code, instructor), allowing users to easily identify and manage their courses.
Editing and Deleting Courses:

Users should have the option to edit or delete a course from their profile if needed.
Clicking on the "Edit" option should allow users to modify the course details through a similar form as the "Add Course" form.
Clicking on the "Delete" option should prompt users for confirmation before permanently removing the course from their profile.
Integration with Calendar or Scheduler (Optional):

Optionally, provide functionality to integrate added courses with the user's calendar or scheduling tool.
Users should be able to easily view their course schedule alongside other commitments, enhancing time management capabilities.
Testing:

Thorough testing should be conducted to ensure all functionalities related to adding, editing, and deleting courses work as expected.
Validate that course data is saved accurately and displayed correctly in the user's profile.
