Registration:

As a new user, I should be able to register for an account by providing a valid email address and creating a secure password.
The system should validate that the email address provided is in the correct format.
Password strength should be assessed, ensuring it meets minimum security requirements (e.g., length, complexity).
Login:

Upon visiting the login page, I should see input fields for email and password.
After entering my credentials and submitting, the system should verify the email-password combination.
If the credentials are incorrect, I should receive a clear error message indicating so.
If the credentials are correct, I should be redirected to the dashboard or the appropriate landing page.
Forgot Password:

In case I forget my password, there should be an option to reset it.
Upon selecting the "Forgot Password" option, I should be prompted to enter my email address.
After submitting my email, I should receive a password reset link via email.
Clicking on the password reset link should take me to a page where I can create a new password.
Security Measures:

Passwords should be stored securely using encryption techniques (e.g., hashing) to protect user data.
There should be measures in place to prevent brute force attacks on the login page (e.g., CAPTCHA, rate limiting).
Sessions should be securely managed to prevent unauthorized access to user accounts.
Implement two-factor authentication (2FA) as an optional extra layer of security.
User Profile:

Users should be able to update their email address and password from their profile settings.
When changing the password, the system should require re-authentication (e.g., current password input) for security purposes.
Error Handling and Notifications:

Error messages should be informative and guide the user on how to rectify the issue (e.g., "Invalid email format", "Password must contain at least one uppercase letter").
Users should receive clear notifications via email for actions such as successful registration, password reset, etc.
Accessibility and User Experience:

The login interface should be intuitive and accessible to users with disabilities.
Feedback should be provided in real-time where possible (e.g., password strength indicator).
The system should remember the user's email (with consent) to streamline the login process.
Testing:

Comprehensive testing should be conducted to ensure all scenarios (valid and invalid inputs, edge cases) are handled appropriately.
Security testing (including penetration testing) should be performed regularly to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities.
